The collected "workshops" here are meant to provide you an end-to-end experience for doing something with Confluent Cloud. There are a variety of use cases available (and that will hopefully  continue to grow over time). If you experience problems with any of the content or would like to request new workshops for new uses, feel free to open an issue.
