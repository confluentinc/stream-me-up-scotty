# <div align="center">Workshop Series: Build Event-Driven Microservices with Confluent Cloud & Apache Kafka</div>

## Introduction

Microservices, events, and containers are dominating today as businesses are relying on event-awareness now more than ever. As teams adapt to support these technologies in production, Apache KafkaÂ® has quickly risen to increase automation, productivity, and business value. 

This three part series will walk through examples of using your microservice architecture with Confluent Cloud & Apache Kafka. The three parts are as follows: 

* [Getting Started with Confluent Cloud](https://github.com/confluentinc/commercial-workshops/tree/master/series-microservices/workshop-getting-started).
* Seamlessly Connect Sources and Sinks to Confluent Cloud with Kafka Connect.
* [Enable Real-time Data Transformations and Stream Processing with ksqlDB](https://github.com/confluentinc/commercial-workshops/tree/master/series-microservices/workshop-ksql).
