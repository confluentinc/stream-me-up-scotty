# <div align="center">Event-Driven Architecture Learning Series</div>

## Introduction

Todayâ€™s modern customers value an end-to-end real-time experience. Businesses that are able to deliver real-time, personalized experiences need to be connected and fueled at all times by a constant supply of real-time event streams and continuous real-time processing. They need access to data in motion.

Join Confluent for our 3-part workshop series to get started with data in motion. Each session includes a virtual guided workshop on how you can use Confluent Cloud to explore event-driven architectures and how these measured and well-informed architectural decisions result in successful outcomes. 

This workshop series is perfect for those looking to get started with Confluent Cloud and build the foundation of your use case with our experienced engineers. 

Attend all 3 sessions or attend 1 session - all of the sessions relate but are independent of each other, so attending all 3 is not required for a valuable experience!
